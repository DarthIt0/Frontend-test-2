# Frontend-test-2

## A solution written in typescript meeting the following requirements:
  
### Create a react app to allow users order food from restaurants:

### Step 1

* Select Meal Category (breakfast/lunch/dinner) (required)
* Need to input number of people (maximum 10) (required)

### Step 2

* Select restaurants that provides meals based on selection in Step 1. (required)

### Step 3

* Select dishes based on the meal and restaurant selected in Step 1 & Step 2.

* First choose a dish
* Then user can add number of servings of the dish (defaulted to 1)
* Also user CAN'T select the same dish twice, rather add more servings.

The total number of dishes at least equals the number of people, max of 10 is allowed.

### Step 4

User can review all his/her previous choices before final submit.

### Notes

* User can't proceed to next step unless have valid inputs on the current step.
* if inputs are invalid, show validation errors.
* At any step user can go back and change their preference on any previous step.
* For the final submit, just print the results in console, as we don't have any backend at this moment.
* Feel free to alter/optimize with the UI/UX.
